If you are here looking for the source code, you are probably at the wrong place.
Since this place contains the executable (even more wrong if you see `Game.exe` file around here).

Grab the source code at: https://github.com/Swyreee/maze-runner

Or if you are really looking for the executable - welcome!

First of all, make sure you haven't tampered with the content.
Then you have two (2) options:

1. You can launch the Game.exe (recommended)
2. You can use `java -jar Game.jar`
    - Having `java` executable at version 21 or higher is a must.
