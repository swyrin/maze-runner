            # How to use.
            Unzip the Game.zip, you should see the `Game.jar` file, `Game.exe` and `resources` folder.
            
            If that is the case, run `java -jar Game.jar`
            
            There is an `.exe` file available for Windows users.
            
            > :warning: This project and the executable was built on **OpenJDK**, I will only provide official support for this.
            > Other JDKs such as: IBM JDK, Oracle JDK - I will provide support *if and only if* you can reproduce on OpenJDK.
            
            > :warning: Minimum Java version: 21
